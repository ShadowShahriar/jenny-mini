## Overview

[English (United States)][1] | [Bengali (Bangladesh)][2]

> This repository showcases an [**ESP32-based**][3] home assistant with a quirky personality. It can help you remotely control up to four appliances in your home via Wi-Fi. You can even chat with it in two languages on Telegram.

[**Jennifer "Jenny" Wakeman**][4] is the protagonist of the show [**My Life as a Teenage Robot**][5]. This project was heavily inspired by the cartoon show and the character itself.

Since Jenny used to be a teenage robot in the show, this bot also behaves like a teenage girl.
